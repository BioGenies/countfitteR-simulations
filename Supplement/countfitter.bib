In this paper, we develop two extensions of the first-order integer-valued autoregressive process with Poisson innovations, based on binomial thinning, for modeling integer-valued time series with equidispersion, underdispersion, and overdispersion. The main properties of the models are derived.

However, most studies use monthly or yearly data and only few studies are available analyzing the impact of weather conditions on daily car crash counts. Furthermore, the studies that are available on a daily level do not explicitly model the data in a time-series context, hereby ignoring the temporal serial correlation that may be present in the data. In this paper, we introduce an integer autoregressive model for modelling count data with time interdependencies. The model is applied to daily car crash data, metereological data and traffic exposure data from the Netherlands aiming at examining the risk impact of weather conditions on the observed counts. The results show that several assumptions related to the effect of weather conditions on crash counts are found to be significant in the data and that if serial temporal correlation is not accounted for in the model, this may produce biased results.},

Measuring the quality of DNA obtained from these samples is often desired; however, there are no widely used techniques available for quantifying damage in highly degraded DNA samples.

The approach uses quantitative PCR to measure the amount of DNA present at several fragment sizes within a sample. According to a model of random degradation the amount of available template will decline exponentially with increasing fragment size in damaged samples, and the frequency of DNA damage ({$\lambda$}) can be estimated by determining the rate of decline.},

@article{deanTestingOverdispersionPoisson1992,
	abstract = {In this article a method for obtaining tests for overdispersion with respect to a natural exponential family is derived. The tests are designed to be powerful against arbitrary alternative mixture models where only the first two moments of the mixed distribution are specified. Various tests for extra-Poisson and extra-binomial variation are obtained as special cases; the use of a particular test may be motivated by a consideration of the mechanism through which the overdispersion may arise. The common occurrence of extra-Poisson and extra-binomial variation has been noted by several authors. However, the Poisson and binomial models remain valid in many instances and, because of their simplicity and appeal, it is of real interest to ascertain when they apply. This paper develops a unifying theory for testing for overdispersion and generalizes tests previously derived, including those by Fisher (1950), Collings and Margolin (1985), and Prentice (1986). It also shows the Pearson statistic to be a score test for overdispersion in a certain situation.},

This article describes problems that occur when ordinary linear regression is used to analyze count data and presents 3 alternative regression models. The simplest, the Poisson regression model, is likely to be misleading unless restrictive assumptions are met because individual counts are usually more variable ("overdispersed") than is implied by the model. This model can be modified in 2 ways to accommodate this problem. In the overdispersed model, a factor can be estimated that corrects the regression model's inferential statistics. In the second alternative, the negative binomial regression model, a random term reflecting unexplained between-subject differences is included in the regression model.

	abstract = {Quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression models have equal numbers of parameters, and either could be used for overdispersed count data. While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasi-Poisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

@article{keene_analysis_2007,
	abstract = {Recurrent events in clinical trials have typically been analysed using either a multiple time-to-event method or a direct approach based on the distribution of the number of events. An area of application for these methods is exacerbation data from respiratory clinical trials. The different approaches to the analysis and the issues involved are illustrated for a large trial (n = 1465) in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For exacerbation rates, clinical interest centres on a direct comparison of rates for each treatment which favours the distribution-based analysis, rather than a time-to-event approach. Poisson regression has often been employed and has recently been recommended as the appropriate method of analysis for COPD exacerbations but the key assumptions often appear unreasonable for this analysis. By contrast use of a negative binomial model which corresponds to assuming a separate Poisson parameter for each subject offers a more appealing approach. Non-parametric methods avoid some of the assumptions required by these models, but do not provide appropriate estimates of treatment effects because of the discrete and bounded nature of the data.},

@article{lapytskoFoCoSimpleRobust2015,
	abstract = {Background
The number of {$\gamma$}H2AX foci per nucleus is an accepted measure of the number of DNA double-strand breaks in single cells. One of the experimental techniques for {$\gamma$}H2AX detection in cultured cells is immunofluorescent labelling of {$\gamma$}H2AX and nuclei followed by microscopy imaging and analysis.

Results
In this study, we present the algorithm FoCo for reliable and robust automatic nuclear foci counting in single cell images. FoCo has the following advantages with respect to other software packages: i) the ability to reliably quantify even densely distributed foci, e.g., on images of cells subjected to radiation doses up to 10~Gy, ii) robustness of foci quantification in the sense of suppressing out-of-focus background signal, and iii) its simplicity. FoCo requires only 5 parameters that have to be adjusted by the user.

Conclusions
FoCo is an open-source user-friendly software with GUI for individual foci counting, which is able to produce reliable and robust foci quantifications even for low signal/noise ratios and densely distributed foci.

@article{leeAnalysisOverdispersedCount2012,
	abstract = {The Poisson model can be applied to the count of events occurring within a specific time period. The main feature of the Poisson model is the assumption that the mean and variance of the count data are equal. However, this equal mean-variance relationship rarely occurs in observational data. In most cases, the observed variance is larger than the assumed variance, which is called overdispersion. Further, when the observed data involve excessive zero counts, the problem of overdispersion results in underestimating the variance of the estimated parameter, and thus produces a misleading conclusion. We illustrated the use of four models for overdispersed count data that may be attributed to excessive zeros. These are Poisson, negative binomial, zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial models. The example data in this article deal with the number of incidents involving human papillomavirus infection. The four models resulted in differing statistical inferences. The Poisson model, which is widely used in epidemiology research, underestimated the standard errors and overstated the significance of some covariates.},

	abstract = {In a Poisson regression model in which observations are either clustered or represented by repeated measurements of counts, the number of observed zero counts is sometimes greater than the expected frequency by the Poisson distribution and overdispersion may remain even after modeling excess zeros. The zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) mixed regression model is suggested to analyze such data. Previous studies have proposed score statistics for testing zero-inflation and overdispersion separately in correlated count data. Here, we also deal with simultaneous score tests for zero-inflation and overdispersion in two-level count data by using the ZINB mixed regression model. Score tests are suggested for (1) zero-inflation in the presence of overdispersion, (2) overdispersion in the presence of zero-inflation, and (3) zero-inflation and overdispersion simultaneously. The level and power of score test statistics are evaluated by a simulation study. The simulation results indicate that score test statistics may occasionally underestimate or overestimate the nominal significance level due to variation in random effects. This study proposes a parametric bootstrap method to overcome this problem. The simulation results of the bootstrap test indicate that score tests hold the nominal level and provide good power.},

@article{lomaxBiologicalConsequencesRadiationinduced2013,
	abstract = {DNA damage of exposed tumour tissue leading to cell death is one of the detrimental effects of ionising radiation that is exploited, with beneficial consequences, for radiotherapy. The pattern of the discrete energy depositions during passage of the ionising track of radiation defines the spatial distribution of lesions induced in DNA with a fraction of the DNA damage sites containing clusters of lesions, formed over a few nanometres, against a background of endogenously induced individual lesions. These clustered DNA damage sites, which may be considered as a signature of ionising radiation, underlie the deleterious biological consequences of ionising radiation. The concepts developed rely in part on the fact that ionising radiation creates significant levels of clustered DNA damage, including complex double-strand breaks (DSB), to kill tumour cells as clustered damage sites are difficult to repair. This reduced repairability of clustered DNA damage using specific repair pathways is exploitable in radiotherapy for the treatment of cancer. We discuss some potential strategies to enhance radiosensitivity by targeting the repair pathways of radiation-induced clustered damage and complex DNA DSB, through inhibition of specific proteins that are not required in the repair pathways for endogenous damage. The variety and severity of DNA damage from ionising radiation is also influenced by the tumour microenvironment, being especially sensitive to the oxygen status of the cells. For instance, nitric oxide is known to influence the types of damage induced by radiation under hypoxic conditions. A potential strategy based on bioreductive activation of pro-drugs to release nitric oxide is discussed as an approach to deliver nitric oxide to hypoxic tumours during radiotherapy. The ultimate aim of this review is to stimulate thinking on how knowledge of the complexity of radiation-induced DNA damage may contribute to the development of adjuncts to radiotherapy.},

	abstract = {Summary: Biomarkers provide a dynamic and powerful approach to understanding the spectrum of neurological disease with applications in observational and analytic epidemiology, randomized clinical trials, screening and diagnosis and prognosis. Defined as alterations in the constituents of tissues or body fluids, these markers offer the means for homogeneous classification of a disease and risk factors, and the can extend our base information about the underlying pathogenesis of disease. Biomarkers can also reflect the entire spectrum of disease from the earliest manifestations to the terminal stages. This brief review describes the major uses of biomarkers in clinical investigation. Careful assessment of the validity of biomarkers is required with respect to the stage of disease. Causes of variability in the measurement of biomarkers range from the individual to the laboratory. Issues that affect the analysis of biomarkers are discussed along with recommendations on how to deal with bias and confounding.},

Despite this, to our knowledge, no standard software packages have implemented specific functions to compute basic probabilities and make simple statistical inference based on these distributions. We present here a set of computational tools that allows the user to face these difficulties by modelling with the Generalized Hermite distribution using the R package hermite. The package can also be used to generate random deviates from a Generalized Hermite distribution and to use basic functions to compute probabilities (density, cumulative density and quantile functions are available), to estimate parameters using the maximum likelihood method and to perform the likelihood ratio test for Poisson assumption against a Generalized Hermite alternative. In order to improve the density and quantile functions performance when the parameters are large, Edgeworth and Cornish-Fisher expansions have been used. Hermite regression is also a useful tool for modeling inflated count data, so its inclusion to a commonly used software like R will make this tool available to a wide range of potential users. Some examples of usage in several fields of application are also given.},

However, it is common to find data that exhibit overdispersion. In practice, the assumption of equidispersion may be violated due to unobserved heterogeneity in the cell population, which will render the variance of observed aberration counts larger than their mean, and/or the frequency of zero counts greater than expected for the Poisson distribution. This phenomenon is observable for both full- and partial-body exposure, but more pronounced for the latter. In this work, different methodologies for analyzing cytogenetic chromosomal aberrations datasets are compared, with special focus on zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated negative binomial models. A score test for testing for zero inflation in Poisson regression models under the identity link is also developed.},

For various reasons, researchers may not address zero inflation. This paper helps educate researchers on (1) the importance of accounting for zero inflation and (2) the consequences of misspecifying the statistical model. Using simulations, we found that when the zero inflation in the data was ignored, estimation was poor and statistically significant findings were missed. When overdispersion within the zero-inflated data was ignored, poor estimation and inflated Type I errors resulted. Recommendations on when to use the ZINB and ZIP models are provided. In an illustration using a two-step model selection procedure (likelihood ratio test and the Vuong test), the ZIP model was correctly identified only when the distributions had moderate means and sample sizes and did not correctly identify the ZINB model or the zero inflation in the ZIP and ZINB distributions.},

It is shown that, in regression, when there are many candidate independent variables, standard variable selection procedures can give very misleading results. Also, by selecting a single model, they ignore model uncertainty and so underestimate the uncertainty about quantities of interest. The Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing, model selection, and accounting for model uncertainty is presented. Implementing this is straightforward through the use of the simple and accurate BIC approximation, and it can be done using the output from standard software. Specific results are presented for most of the types of model commonly used in sociology. It is shown that this approach overcomes the difficulties with P-values and standard model selection procedures based on them. It also allows easy comparison of nonnested models, and permits the quantification of the evidence for a null hypothesis of interest, such as a convergence theory or a hypothesis about societal norms.},

Due to the discovery of new molecules and new emerging bioanalytical problems, there is an ongoing demand for a technology platform that provides a broad range of assays with a user-friendly flexibility and rapid adaptability to new applications. Here we describe a highly versatile microscopy platform, VideoScan, for the rapid and simultaneous analysis of various assay formats based on fluorescence microscopic detection. The technological design is equally suitable for assays in solution, microbead-based assays and cell pattern recognition.

The paper discusses the technological principle of the platform regarding data acquisition and processing. Microbead-based and solution applications for the detection of diverse biomolecules, including antigens, antibodies, peptides, oligonucleotides and amplicons in small reaction volumes, are presented together with a high-content detection of autoimmune antibodies using a HEp-2 cell assay.

@article{rodiger_quantification_2018,
	abstract = {Background: DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are the most severe form of DNA damage in eukaryotic cells treated with ionizing radiation or chemotherapeutic drugs. They can be quantitatively assessed by fluorescence imaging of phosphorylated histone protein H2AX ({$\gamma$}H2AX), where the number of {$\gamma$}H2AX foci represents the number of DNA DSB. Real-time assessment of DSB could help tailoring cytotoxic therapies to individual patients regarding both response and adverse events. This would require reliable automated quantification technology not yet routinely available. Here we explore this concept in the context of malignant lymphoma. Methods: To investigate the DSB response to cytotoxic treatment in vitro , peripheral lymphocytes of healthy donors were incubated with bendamustine, an alkylating drug commonly used in lymphoma therapy. To mimic the clinical setting, the drug concentration per number of donor cells was either calculated as a standard dose or based on the body surface area of the individual donor. DNA DSB were quantified by an automatized immunofluorescence {$\gamma$}H2AX assay using the AKLIDES NUK ® system. Results: Across all donors, the mean number of {$\gamma$}H2AX foci per cell was 1.29, IQR (1.08) after bendamustine treatment as opposed to 0.04, IQR (0.125) in untreated freshly isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The standardized incubation dosage resulted in a mean of 0.89, IQR (0.51) foci per cell, while individualized dose calculation yielded 1.57, IQR (0.5) foci per cell. The difference in {$\gamma$}H2AX foci between the two dosage calculations was significant (P=0.036). In addition, we observed a trend towards a negative correlation between the donors’ body surface area and the number of foci per cell. Between donors, no significant correlation of the number of foci in response to a given dose was observed. Dose titrations on the cells of individual donors demonstrated a significant response (P Conclusions: The automatic AKLIDES analysis platform can assess {$\gamma$}H2AX foci for routine use. The individual {$\gamma$}H2AX foci response to in vitro bendamustine is dose-dependent and can be monitored timely. Calculating individual in vitro dosage from the donor’s body surface area resulted in a broad variation of foci counts between individuals, suggesting that this dosage method does not result in equivalent biological effects among different individuals. Adjusting the dose individually based on biological responses such as DNA DSB could offer a way of personalized medicine with conventional substances, reducing toxicity while increasing therapeutic efficacy.},

	abstract = {Antibody assessment is an essential part in the serological diagnosis of autoimmune diseases. However, different diagnostic strategies have been proposed for the work up of sera in particular from patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease (SARD). In general, screening for SARD-associated antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) is followed by confirmatory testing covering different assay techniques. Due to lacking automation, standardization, modern data management, and human bias in IIF screening, this two-stage approach has recently been challenged by multiplex techniques particularly in laboratories with high workload. However, detection of antinuclear antibodies by IIF is still recommended to be the gold standard method for antibody screening in sera from patients with suspected SARD. To address the limitations of IIF and to meet the demand for cost-efficient autoantibody screening, automated IIF methods employing novel pattern recognition algorithms for image analysis have been introduced recently. In this respect, the AKLIDES technology has been the first commercially available platform for automated interpretation of cell-based IIF testing and provides multiplexing by addressable microbead immunoassays for confirmatory testing. This paper gives an overview of recently published studies demonstrating the advantages of this new technology for SARD serology.},

@article{yangTestingOverdispersionZeroinflated2009,
	abstract = {The zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) model is used to account for commonly occurring overdispersion detected in data that are initially analyzed under the zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model. Tests for overdispersion (Wald test, likelihood ratio test [LRT], and score test) based on ZINB model for use in ZIP regression models have been developed. Due to similarity to the ZINB model, we consider the zero-inflated generalized Poisson (ZIGP) model as an alternate model for overdispersed zero-inflated count data. The score test has an advantage over the LRT and the Wald test in that the score test only requires that the parameter of interest be estimated under the null hypothesis. This paper proposes score tests for overdispersion based on the ZIGP model and illustrates that the derived score statistics are exactly the same as the score statistics under the ZINB model. A simulation study indicates the proposed score statistics are preferred to other tests for higher empirical power. In practice, based on the approximate mean\textendash variance relationship in the data, the ZINB or ZIGP model can be considered, and a formal score test based on asymptotic standard normal distribution can be employed for assessing overdispersion in the ZIP model. We provide an example to illustrate the procedures for data analysis.},

Cancer frequently results from damage to multiple genes controlling cell division and tumor suppressors. It is known that genomic integrity is closely monitored by several surveillance mechanisms, DNA damage checkpoint, DNA repair machinery and mitotic checkpoint. A defect in the regulation of any of these mechanisms often results in genomic instability, which predisposes the cell to malignant transformation. Posttranslational modifications of the histone tails are closely associated with regulation of the cell cycle as well as chromatin structure. Nevertheless, DNA methylation status is also related to genomic integrity. We attempt to summarize recent developments in this field and discuss the debate of driving force of tumor initiation and progression.},

	abstract = {A key modality of non-surgical cancer management is DNA damaging therapy that causes DNA double-strand breaks that are preferentially toxic to rapidly dividing cancer cells. Double-strand break repair capacity is recognized as an important mechanism in drug resistance and is therefore a potential target for adjuvant chemotherapy. Additionally, spontaneous and environmentally induced DSBs are known to promote cancer, making DSB evaluation important as a tool in epidemiology, clinical evaluation and in the development of novel pharmaceuticals. Currently available assays to detect double-strand breaks are limited in throughput and specificity and offer minimal information concerning the kinetics of repair. Here, we present the CometChip, a 96-well platform that enables assessment of double-strand break levels and repair capacity of multiple cell types and conditions in parallel and integrates with standard high-throughput screening and analysis technologies. We demonstrate the ability to detect multiple genetic deficiencies in double-strand break repair and evaluate a set of clinically relevant chemical inhibitors of one of the major double-strand break repair pathways, non-homologous end-joining. While other high-throughput repair assays measure residual damage or indirect markers of damage, the CometChip detects physical double-strand breaks, providing direct measurement of damage induction and repair capacity, which may be useful in developing and implementing treatment strategies with reduced side effects.},

	abstract = {DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are critical cellular lesions that represent a high risk for genetic instability. DSBs initiate repair mechanisms by recruiting sensor proteins and mediators. DSB biomarkers, like phosphorylated histone 2AX (γH2AX) and p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), are detectable by immunofluorescence as either foci or distinct patterns in the vicinity of DSBs. The correlation between the number of foci and the number of DSBs makes them a useful tool for quantification of DNA damage in precision medicine, forensics and cancer research. The quantification and characterization of foci ideally uses large cell numbers to achieve statistical validity. This requires software tools that are suitable for the analysis of large complex data sets, even for users with limited experience in digital image processing. This includes, for example, pre-processing, transformation and presentation of the data in a less complex structure for further data analysis. There are numerous software solutions for the analysis of foci. This review gives an overview of open source image processing software packages, including graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as CellProfiler, Icy and ImageJ/Fiji. Software packages like CellProfiler and Icy enable to gain high-content information about DSB biomarkers. Programming languages, like Python, are discussed briefly.},

	abstract = {Analysis of phosphorylated histone protein H2AX (γH2AX) foci is currently the most sensitive method to detect DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). This protein modification has the potential to become an individual biomarker of cellular stress, especially in the diagnosis and monitoring of neoplastic diseases. To make γH2AX foci analysis available as a routine screening method, different software approaches for automated immunofluorescence pattern evaluation have recently been developed. In this study, we used novel pattern recognition algorithms on the AKLIDES® platform to automatically analyze immunofluorescence images of γH2AX foci and compared the results with visual assessments. Dose- and time-dependent γH2AX foci formation was investigated in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) treated with the chemotherapeutic drug etoposide (ETP). Moreover, the AKLIDES system was used to analyze the impact of different immunomodulatory reagents on γH2AX foci formation in PBMCs. Apart from γH2AX foci counting the use of novel pattern recognition algorithms allowed the measurement of their fluorescence intensity and size, as well as the analysis of overlapping γH2AX foci. The comparison of automated and manual foci quantification showed overall a good correlation. After ETP exposure, a clear dose-dependent increase of γH2AX foci formation was evident using the AKLIDES as well as Western blot analysis. Kinetic experiments on PBMCs incubated with 5 μM ETP demonstrated a peak in γH2AX foci formation after 4 to 8 h, while a removal of ETP resulted in a strong reduction of γH2AX foci after 1 to 4 h. In summary, this study demonstrated that the AKLIDES system can be used as an efficient automatic screening tool for γH2AX foci analysis by providing new evaluation features and facilitating the identification of drugs which induce or modulate DNA damage. © 2013 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

The maximum number of nucleotide pairs (a) between two independently induced single-strand breaks in opposite strands of the DNA which cannot prevent the occurrence of a double-strand break was found to amount to about 16. This value did not differ significantly for the four types of bacteriophage DNA investigated (T4, T7 and PM2 DNA, and replicative form DNA of phage phiX174) and was the same in 10(-2) M phosphate buffer containing 0, 0.5 or 1 M NaCl. In 10(-3) M phosphate buffer a was 34 nucleotide pairs. Evidence is presented that the relatively large value of a has to be ascribed at least partly to a temporal local denaturation accompanying the induction of a single-strand scission. A contribution of base damage that labilizes the DNA-helix, between two single-strand breaks to the high value of a can not be excluded.},

	abstract = {Detection of γ-H2AX foci as a measure of DNA double strand break induction and repair provides the basis of a rapid approach to establish individual radiosensitivity. However, the assignment of criteria to define increased radiosensitivity is not straightforward. Experimental end points, analytical methods and proliferative status of the cells sampled for analysis are important. All these issues are addressed in the present study, which was prompted by a clinical request to assess the radiosensitivity status of an SCID paediatric patient being considered for bone marrow transplantation.

We investigated the kinetics of repair of radiation-induced γ-H2AX foci in proliferating and confluent cultures of skin fibroblasts obtained from the patient, and from normal and radiosensitive (Artemis-deficient) controls. As well as the standard approach of averaging foci per cell over the entire population (“standard average”), we also examined foci per cell frequency distributions and calculated average foci per cell values in the major Poisson-distributed subpopulation (“principal average”). This approach allowed to avoid distortions such as that due to the S/G2 population in proliferating cells, with focus numbers approaching twice the normal, and to detect subpopulations of cells with defects in focus formation and repair.

From the “standard average” analysis and co-localisation of γ-H2AX foci with 53BP1 we assigned the patient's repair status as close-to-normal. However, analysis of “principal average”, foci per cell frequency distributions and survival curves challenged this initial conclusion.

These studies indicate new dimensions of the γ-H2AX assay that, with further elaboration and exemplification, have the potential to augment its power to predict radiosensitivity.},

Limitations in the existing standardized statistical methodology have been identified and categorized, and the reasons for these limitations have been explored. Statistical problems generally occur due to either low numbers of aberrations leading to large uncertainties or deviations in aberration-per-cell distributions leading to over- or under-dispersion with respect to the Poisson model. A number of difficulties also stem from limitations of the classical statistical methodology, which requires that chromosome aberration yields be considered as something “fixed” and thus provides a deterministic estimate of radiation dose and associated confidence limits (because an assignment of a probability to an event is based solely on the observed frequency of occurrence of the event). Therefore, it is suggested that solutions to the listed problems should be based in the Bayesian framework. This will allow the investigator to take a probabilistic approach to analysis of cytogenetic data, which can be considered highly appropriate for biological dose estimation.},

Materials and methods: MN dose response (DR) curves were obtained by exposing isolated lymphocytes of 10 different donors to doses ranging from 0–4 Gy g-rays or 0–2 Gy neutrons. Also, gH2AX foci DR curves were obtained following exposure to doses ranging from 0–0.5 Gy of either g-rays or neutrons. Foci kinetics for lymphocytes for a single donor exposed to 0.5 Gy g-rays or neutrons were studied up to 24 hours post-irradiation.
Results: Micronuclei yields following neutron exposure were consistently higher compared to that from 60Co g-rays. All MN yields were over-dispersed compared to a Poisson distribution. Over-dispersion was higher after neutron irradiation for all doses  0.1 Gy. Up to 4 hours post-irradiation lower yields of neutroninduced gH2AX foci were observed. Between 4 and 24 hours the numbers of foci from neutrons were consistently higher than that from g-rays. The half-live of foci disappearance is only marginally longer for neutrons compared to that from g-rays. Foci formations were more likely to be over-dispersed for neutron irradiations.
Conclusion: Although neutrons are more effective to induce MN, the absolute number of induced gH2AX foci are less at first compared to g-rays. With time neutron-induced foci are more persistent. These findings are helpful for using gH2AX foci in biodosimetry and to understand the repair of neutron-induced cellular damage.},

	abstract = {The identification of severely exposed individuals and reassurance of the ‘worried well’ are of prime importance for initial triage following a large scale radiation accident. We aim to develop the γ-H2AX foci assay into a rapid biomarker tool for use in accidents. Here, five laboratories established a standard operating procedure and analysed 100 ex vivo γ-irradiated, 4 or 24h incubated and overnight-shipped lymphocyte samples from four donors to generate γ-H2AX reference data, using manual and/or automated foci scoring strategies. In addition to acute, homogeneous exposures to 0, 1, 2 and 4Gy, acute simulated partial body (4Gy to 50\% of cells) and protracted exposures (4Gy over 24h) were analysed. Data from all laboratories could be satisfactorily fitted with linear dose response functions. Average yields observed at 4h post exposure were 2–4 times higher than at 24h and varied considerably between laboratories. Automated scoring caused larger uncertainties than manual scoring and was unable to identify partial exposures, which were detectable in manually scored samples due to their overdispersed foci distributions. Protracted exposures were detectable but doses could not be accurately estimated with the γ-H2AX assay. We conclude that the γ-H2AX assay may be useful for rapid triage following a recent acute radiation exposure. The potentially higher speed and convenience of automated relative to manual foci scoring needs to be balanced against its compromised accuracy and inability to detect partial body exposures. Regular re-calibration or inclusion of reference samples may be necessary to ensure consistent results between laboratories or over long time periods.},

@article{clingen_histone_2008,
	abstract = {The aims of this study were to investigate mechanisms of action involved in H2AX phosphorylation by DNA interstrand crosslinking (ICL) agents and determine whether gammaH2AX could be a suitable pharmacological marker for identifying potential ICL cellular chemosensitivity. In normal human fibroblasts, after treatment with nitrogen mustard (HN2) or cisplatin, the peak gammaH2AX response was detected 2-3 h after the peak of DNA ICLs measured using the comet assay, a validated method for detecting ICLs in vitro or in clinical samples. Detection of gammaH2AX foci by immunofluorescence microscopy could be routinely detected with 6-10 times lower concentrations of both drugs compared to detection of ICLs using the comet assay. A major pathway for repairing DNA ICLs is the initial unhooking of the ICL by the ERCC1-XPF endonuclease followed by homologous recombination. HN2 or cisplatin-induced gammaH2AX foci persisted significantly longer in both, ERCC1 or XRCC3 (homologous recombination) defective Chinese hamster cells that are highly sensitive to cell killing by ICL agents compared to wild type or ionising radiation sensitive XRCC5 cells. An advantage of using gammaH2AX immunofluorescence over the comet assay is that it appears to detect ICL chemosensitivity in both ERCC1 and HR defective cells. With HN2 and cisplatin, gammaH2AX foci also persisted in chemosensitive human ovarian cancer cells (A2780) compared to chemoresistant (A2780cisR) cells. These results show that gammaH2AX can act as a highly sensitive and general marker of DNA damage induced by HN2 or cisplatin and shows promise for predicting potential cellular chemosensitivity to ICL agents.},
